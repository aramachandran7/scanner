# Note 2: The script uses "pyserial" which must be installed.  If you have

#         first.

# Note 3: While this script is running you can not re-program the Arduino.
#         Before downloading a new Arduino sketch, you must exit this

#	1) From Arduino's "Tools" menu, select "Port"
#	2) It will show you which Port is used to connect to the Arduino

# For Apple computers, the name is formatted like: "/dev/tty.usbmodemfa141"
